    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Fresh pasta dough is very different than dried pasta made al dente. It requires very little cooking and is pillowy soft with an added dimension of flavor that is difficult to describe, but worth the effort.

        <li>169 grams all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>85 grams durum flour</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flours together in a stand mixer with paddle attachment until evenly distributed</li>
        <li>Add eggs and egg yolk one at a time until incorporated into flour</li>
        <li>Add water 1 tablespoon at a time until the flour forms large, moist crumbs</li>
