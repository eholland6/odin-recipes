    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        From the Momofuku cookbook, this broth takes a full day to make so plan accordingly but is worth the effort.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 3" x 6" pieces konbu</li>
        <li>6 quarts water</li>
        <li>2 cups dried shiitake mushrooms, rinsed</li>
        <li>4 pounds chicken, either a whole bird or legs</li>
        <li>5 pounds meaty pork bones</li>
        <li>1 pound smoky bacon</li>
        <li>1 bunch scallions</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, halved</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>Taré</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse konbu, then add to water to 8-quart stockpot. Bring to simmer and let steep for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove konbu from the pot and add shiitakes. Turn heat back to high and bring to a boil, then immediately simmer for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 400° F</li>
        <li>Remove mushrooms using a spider or slotted spoon. Add chicken to the pot and keep liquid at a simmer. Check chicken after an hour. The meat should pull easily from the bones. If it doesn't continue to simmer until it does. Then remove the chicken from the pot.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is simmering, roast pork bones on a baking sheet for an hour, turning them over after 30 minutes to brown all over.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the pot and add roasted pork bones as well as the bacon. Maintain a simmer, remove the bacon after 45 minutes and continue roasting pork bones for another 6 hours. Replenish water in the pot until hour 4 or 5 </li>
        <li>Add the scallions, onion, and carrots and simmer for the final 45 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove and discard simmered bones and vegetables and pass the broth through a fine strainer or a strainer lined with cheesecloth. </li>
        <li>Season broth with taré to taste. I use a lot...</li>
    </ol>
